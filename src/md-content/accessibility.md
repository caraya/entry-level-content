## What is accessibility?


## What is assistive technology

As a last step we'll take a page we've retrofitted and have it read by VoiceOver, the screen reader bundled as part of MacOS X. This will give us an idea of what a user with visual disabilities experiences when they read the content.

Windows users can install a free NVDA screen reader for Windows: [https://www.nvaccess.org/](https://www.nvaccess.org/)

Accessibility is one of the most important aspects of development and one that we don't pay as much attention as we should.

We will look at ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications), what it is, and how we can use it in our content to help improve the accessibility of web applications and pages.

We'll also look at ARIA best practices and authoring guidelines.
