Some times I wonder if it ever gets better. It's been 17 years since I my dad passed away and I can't get him out of my head with all the baggage that it involves.

It's telling for me that I can remember exactly where I was and what I was doing when my cousin called me to let me know that he had passed away. I almost expected it and I had a prescient moment of "I think I know why you're calling" and that sinking pit in your stomach where you want to puke on empty.

There are so many things I regret having said and so many things I regret keeping quiet.  I never made it a secret that he's one of the reasons why I'm in the US and, deep down, why I chose not to go back
